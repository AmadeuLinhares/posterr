# Posterr

I developed a modern social feed application where users can create posts, repost content, and interact with others in real time. The project was built with a strong focus on developer experience, performance, and scalability.

üîß Tech Highlights
	‚Ä¢	React Query (TanStack Query) ‚Üí for powerful server-state management, cache updates, infinite queries for feeds, and optimistic UI when following/unfollowing users.
	‚Ä¢	shadcn/ui ‚Üí provided accessible, Radix-based UI primitives with full Tailwind customization (Drawer, Tabs, Avatar, Tooltip, etc.), allowing me to implement a consistent and theme-aware design system.
	‚Ä¢	Zod + React Hook Form ‚Üí schema-based form validation with type inference, ensuring robust input validation and clean error handling.
	‚Ä¢	TypeScript ‚Üí strong typing across API schemas, queries, and components for safer, maintainable code.
	‚Ä¢	Date-fns ‚Üí used for date formatting and utilities (e.g., ‚ÄúMarch 25, 2021‚Äù display, ‚ÄúisToday‚Äù checks).
	‚Ä¢	Custom API Simulation (fakeApiFetch, fakeApiSave) ‚Üí mimicked backend requests with delays, enabling realistic optimistic updates and cache synchronization during development.

‚ú® Features
	‚Ä¢	Infinite scroll feed with react-intersection-observer.
	‚Ä¢	Post creation via a Drawer component with conditional validation (e.g., content required only for quotes/regular posts).
	‚Ä¢	Optimistic follow/unfollow with instant UI feedback and rollback on failure.
	‚Ä¢	Query param‚Äìdriven UI state (e.g., opening drawer with ?isQuote=true).
	‚Ä¢	Responsive, accessible design powered by Tailwind and shadcn components.
