# Posterr

I developed a modern social feed application where users can create posts, repost content, and interact with others in real time. The project was built with a strong focus on developer experience, performance, and scalability.

🔧 Configs
	• A function called injectMock was created to inject the necessary information to run the system. If you want to run thhe project from strach, please clean your local storage and reload the page.
	• packmanager: pnpm
	• Node version: v24.0.1

🚀 Start project
	• pnpm i
	• pnpm run dev

🔧 Tech Highlights
	•	React Query (TanStack Query) → for powerful server-state management, cache updates, infinite queries for feeds, and optimistic UI when following/unfollowing users.
	•	shadcn/ui → provided accessible, Radix-based UI primitives with full Tailwind customization (Drawer, Tabs, Avatar, Tooltip, etc.), allowing me to implement a consistent and theme-aware design system.
	•	Zod + React Hook Form → schema-based form validation with type inference, ensuring robust input validation and clean error handling.
	•	TypeScript → strong typing across API schemas, queries, and components for safer, maintainable code.
	•	Date-fns → used for date formatting and utilities (e.g., “March 25, 2021” display, “isToday” checks).
	•	Custom API Simulation (fakeApiFetch, fakeApiSave) → mimicked backend requests with delays, enabling realistic optimistic updates and cache synchronization during development.

✨ Features
	•	Infinite scroll feed with react-intersection-observer.
	•	Post creation via a Drawer component with conditional validation (e.g., content required only for quotes/regular posts).
	•	Optimistic follow/unfollow with instant UI feedback and rollback on failure.
	•	Query param–driven UI state (e.g., opening drawer with ?isQuote=true).
	•	Responsive, accessible design powered by Tailwind and shadcn components.
